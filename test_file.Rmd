## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Set working directory
setwd("~/Documents/Year 2 Fall 2024/STP 530/Project/stp_530_repo")

# Read data
cab_df <- read.csv("cab_rides.csv")
weather <- read.csv("weather.csv")


# ---------- MERGING THE CAB RIDES AND WEATHER DATA ---------- #



# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)

# Step 1: Convert timestamps to datetime
cab_df$date_time <- as_datetime(cab_df$time_stamp / 1000, origin = "1970-01-01")
weather$date_time <- as_datetime(weather$time_stamp, origin = "1970-01-01")

# Step 2: Create merge_date column with consistent formatting
cab_df <- cab_df %>%
  mutate(
    merge_date = paste0(source, " - ", format(date_time, "%Y-%m-%d"), " - ", sprintf("%02d", hour(date_time)))
  )

weather <- weather %>%
  mutate(
    merge_date = paste0(location, " - ", format(date_time, "%Y-%m-%d"), " - ", sprintf("%02d", hour(date_time)))
  )

# Step 3: Group by 'merge_date' with numeric-only averaging, and replace NA in 'rain' with 0
groupby_value <- weather %>%
  group_by(merge_date) %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(rain = ifelse(is.na(rain), 0, rain))

# Step 4: Merge without dropping NA values and inspect
merged_df <- cab_df %>%
  left_join(groupby_value, by = "merge_date", suffix = c("", "_w"))

# Inspect NA patterns in the merged dataframe
print("Summary of NA values in merged_df after fix:")
print(colSums(is.na(merged_df)))

# Display the first few rows, including rows with NAs
print("Merged dataframe (first 10 rows):")
(head(merged_df, 10))
# View(merged_df)


# ---------- 

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
